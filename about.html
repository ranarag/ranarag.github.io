<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I graduated from the Computer Science and Technology department(with Hons.) of IIEST Shibpur in the year 2017.
   I worked as a software engineer at Polaris Networks for a year(July 2017 - Jul 2018).
   Currently I am at IIT Kharagpur as a Junior Research Fellow at IIT Kharagpur under the supervision of Dr.Saptarshi Ghosh</p>

<p>My primary domains of work/experience are Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing,
	and Deep Learning.</p>
