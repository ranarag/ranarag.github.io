<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Under-graduate at IIEST Shibpur currently pursuing a B.E. degree in Computer
Science and Technology.IIEST Shibpur is ranked as one of the top 20
higher educational institutions in India, as per the latest NIRF rankings
conducted by the MHRD, Government of India.</p>

<p>The field of Machine Learning excites me a lot and thus I have done quite a few
projects in this field.</p>

<p>My primary domains of work/experience are Information Retrieval ,
	Deep Learning and Algorithmic Coding.</p>

<p>I am actively seeking a full-time role as a Data Engineer /Data Scientist
starting July 2017</p>
