### What is Tensorflow?

Tensorflow is an open source software for machine learning developed by Google.Tensorflow's, as one can get from its name, mainly handles matrices(or tensors), its mathematical operations and differentiation efficiently.It is just like Theano but with some extra features like  it can be used on distributed systems.
