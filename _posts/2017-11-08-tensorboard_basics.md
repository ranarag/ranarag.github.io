## What is TensorBoard?

TensorBoard is a module of Tensorflow that provides a suite of visualisation tools that help in understanding, debugging and optimize the model created in Tensorflow.

## Installing TensorBoard

TensorBoard is installed along with Tensorflow.
It can also be installed as a standalone software from [Standalone TensorBoard](https://github.com/dmlc/tensorboard)
