Some differences between c++ and java:
1. Java compiled code is platform independent whereas c++ compiled code is
  platform dependent

2. Java interpreter reports the run-time error that caused the execution to halt
  unlike in c/c++ programs which may simply crash

3. c/c++ do not have strict sizes for the fundamental datatypes(varies from
  machine to machine) whereas Java defines strict sizes for their datatypes

4. Java has additional positive and negative zeros, positive and neagtive infinites and "nan"(not a number values)

5. c/c++ has functions while Java has methods.In c/c++ functions can be defined outside a class
Java doesnot allow methods to be defined outside a class.
