<p>Data scientists are required to draw conclusions about a group, a.k.a <em>population</em> from a few <em>samples</em> of it because
 getting the entire population is intractable.
This process of drawing samples is called <em>sampling</em>. There are different kinds of sampling , few of which are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Random sampling</li>
  <li>Clustered sampling</li>
  <li>Stratified sampling</li>
  <li>Systematic sampling
You can read about them over <a href="https://medcraveonline.com/BBIJ/BBIJ-05-00149.pdf">here</a>
The drawing of conclusions or <em>inference</em> about the population from the samples is called <em>statistical inference</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this section we will consider two different types of samples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sampling with Replacement</li>
  <li>Sampling without Replacement</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="random-sampling-with-replacement">Random Sampling with Replacement</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, this is a type of sampling where each member of the population may be included more than once.
Itâ€™s like picking a ball from an urn and then putting it back into the urn.</p>

<h2 id="random-sampling-without-replacement">Random Sampling without Replacement</h2>
<p>In this type of sampling, each member of the population can be included atmost once.
A similar example for this type of sampling would be picking a ball from the urn and not putting it back inside the urn.</p>

<h2 id="sampling-statistics">Sampling statistics</h2>
<p>A quantity obtained from the sample for the purpose estimating a population parameter is called a <em>sample statistic</em> or briefly <em>statistic</em>.
Mathematically, a sample statistic for a sample of size <script type="math/tex">n</script> can be defined as a function of the random variables <script type="math/tex">X_1, X_2,...,X_n</script> i.e., <script type="math/tex">g(X_1, X_2,...,X_n)</script>.
The function <script type="math/tex">g(X_1, X_2,...,X_n)</script> is another random variable whose values can be represented by <script type="math/tex">g(x_1, x_2,...,x_n)</script>.</p>
