I"a	<p>Some differences between c++ and java:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Java compiled code is platform independent whereas c++ compiled code is
  platform dependent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Java interpreter reports the run-time error that caused the execution to halt
  unlike in c/c++ programs which may simply crash</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>c/c++ do not have strict sizes for the fundamental datatypes(varies from
  machine to machine) whereas Java defines strict sizes for their datatypes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Java has additional positive and negative zeros, positive and neagtive infinites and “nan”(not a number values)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>c/c++ has functions while Java has methods.In c/c++ functions can be defined outside a class
Java doesnot allow methods to be defined outside a class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike c++  arrays, Java arrays are objects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike c++, strings are immutable in Java.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While in c++ classes “public”, “private” and “protected” are labels , in Java they are modifiers. Each member has its own access modifier. Java also has a no-modifier(a.k.a package-private) option which makes
the member visible only within its own package.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike c++, Java method definitions do not have
semicolon at the end of their closing brackets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Java uses the “extends” keyword while inherting features of a class to specify the superclass.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Java <a href="http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/java-questions/multiple-inheritance/">does not support multiple inheritance but supports multiple interfaces</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike c++ Java has <a href="www.javatpoint.com/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface">interfaces which is a bit different from abstract class</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Java superclass constructors are callled using the keyword “super”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike c++ Java has class hierarchy. The  “Object” class is the root of this hierarchy.
All classes are subclasses of this root class.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
